# Umbriel Companion

Umbriel chooses a layout per workspace and tracks the active keybind submap. This plugin puts both in the bar: the
widget can show either the focused workspace layout or the active submap, and its panel switches the layout, runs the
actions that only exist in the active layout, resizes or floats the focused window, and jumps between workspaces.

## Plugin

Manifest id `noctalia/umbriel-companion`.

- `bar` - bar widget. Shows the focused workspace layout by default, or the active submap when selected in its
  settings. Click opens the panel; a scroll flick cycles scrolling → dwindle → master. The widget hides itself
  outside an Umbriel session.
- `panel` - the layout panel, attached to the widget. Open it without a widget with
  `noctalia msg panel-toggle noctalia/umbriel-companion:panel`.
- `service` - the only entry that talks to the compositor. It holds `umbriel subscribe workspaces,submap` open,
  republishes every pushed line as the snapshot each UI entry reads, and runs every requested `umbriel msg` action.

## Requirements

- `umbriel` on `PATH`, inside a running Umbriel session, with the `workspaces` and `submap` subscription families.
  Every other compositor gets a hidden widget and an inert panel.

## Usage

Add the **Umbriel Companion** widget to a bar from Settings → Bar, or open the panel through IPC.

The panel targets the workspace Umbriel considers focused - the active workspace of the focused output - and names it
at the top, because that is the workspace `workspace-set-layout` acts on, not the one the panel is drawn over.

- **Layout** - Scrolling, Dwindle, Master. The current layout is highlighted. The override lasts until a config
  reload reasserts the configured mode.
- **Layout actions** - master layout gets the master-count steppers; scrolling gets *Center column*. Dwindle has no
  layout-scoped action, so the row disappears.
- **Focused window** - width presets (⅓, ½, ⅔, full), floating, pinned, fullscreen, maximize, and centering for a
  floating window.
- **Workspaces** - every workspace of every output with its layout. Click switches to it; right-click moves the
  focused window or its whole column there.

Nothing here polls. Umbriel's IPC event stream carries the workspace list with each workspace's layout mode and the
active submap. The service reads it line by line, so the bar and panel change on the same event as the keybind, and
an idle session costs nothing at all.

## Settings

- **Bar display** (widget) - choose the focused workspace layout or the active keybind submap from a dropdown. Submap
  mode shows a keyboard glyph and the submap name, using *Default* when no submap is active.
- **Show layout name** (widget) - print the layout next to the glyph on a horizontal bar.
- **Show workspace name** (widget) - print the focused workspace name next to the glyph on a horizontal bar.
- **Scroll cycles the layout** (widget) - turn the scroll gesture off if you would rather not change layouts by
  accident.
